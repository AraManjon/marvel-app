# Marvel App

Marvel app is a project that allows you to see all the characters of Marvel Comics. This app has only one page but it is designed to grow into more sections. 

## Set up the project

Before explaining anything else, here is the commands to initialize the project:

> git clone git@github.com:AraManjon/marvel-app.git

> cd marvel-app

> npm i

> npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.\

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Use API Marvel

To use the app correctly you'll need to create an API_KEY_PUBLIC and API_KEY_PRIVATE. Create an .env file in root directory and save this before start.

REACT_APP_API_PRIVATE_KEY = your private key
REACT_APP_API_PUBLIC_KEY = your public key

See how to create an API key in [Marvel API documentation](https://developer.marvel.com/account).

## Technologies of choice

- **React**: this project is created with Create React App

- **Typescript**: this project was coded with Typescript which gives the program syntax.

## Future improvements

Here are some improvements and features:

 - Acceptance criteria testing to ensure that the product requirements are working.

 - Implementation of detailed characters

 - Implement reducer and dispatch instead of useState to retrieve the list of characters to better control the logic call and implement some optimizations.

## Final notes

I like to put all my love in the things I do, and so I did in this small project. I enjoyed it so much and regardless of the result I hope you also enjoyed the review.
